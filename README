To learn more about Zorbage please visit https://github.com/bdezonia/zorbage

The zorbage-viewer uses the NetCDF, GDAL, and SCIFIO file format
translation libraries to open many image types into zorbage structures.
It is a simple file viewer that will be undergoing continued
development.

Note that to run the viewer you need to first install GDAL on your machine.
There are directions for doing so in the zorbage-gdal README. See
https://github.com/bdezonia/zorbage-gdal for more information.
